# Chunking and Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of chunking techniques and fixes to resolve the `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` quota limits and TTS generation issues in the ClauseWise application.

## Problems Solved

### 1. API Quota Limits (429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED)
**Problem**: Gemini API calls were hitting rate limits due to large document processing without chunking.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive chunking and rate limiting across all AI-powered features.

### 2. TTS Generation Failures
**Problem**: `edge-tts` was failing with "No audio was received" errors.

**Solution**: Added retry logic, better error handling, and fallback mechanisms.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Gemini Utils (`utils/gemini_utils_optimized.py`)

#### Chunking Implementation
- **Text Chunking**: `_chunk_text()` method splits large documents into manageable chunks (8,000 characters) while preserving sentence boundaries
- **Rate Limiting**: `_make_rate_limited_request()` with exponential backoff and retry logic
- **Batch Processing**: Processes chunks sequentially with delays between requests

#### Key Features Added
```python
# Configuration
MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST = 30000
CHUNK_SIZE = 8000
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 1.0
MAX_RETRIES = 3

# New Methods
_chunk_text()           # Split text into chunks
_make_rate_limited_request()  # Rate-limited API calls
_analyze_chunk()        # Analyze individual chunks
_simple_text_request()  # Simple text generation
_structured_request()   # Structured JSON responses
```

#### Document Analysis with Chunking
- Splits documents into chunks
- Analyzes each chunk separately
- Combines results intelligently
- Handles rate limits gracefully

### 2. Enhanced Clause Simplification (`utils/simplify_utils.py`)

#### Batch Processing
- **Batch Size**: Processes 3 clauses at a time
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-second delays between batches
- **Error Handling**: Continues processing even if individual clauses fail

#### Key Features
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 3
DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES = 2.0

# Batch processing with concurrent execution
# Graceful error handling per clause
# Fallback to original text if simplification fails
```

### 3. Enhanced Document Type Classification (`utils/doc_type_classifier.py`)

#### Chunked Classification
- Uses first chunk for large documents (4,000 character limit)
- Fallback to keyword-based classification
- Structured JSON responses with confidence scores

#### Key Features
```python
# For large documents, use first chunk only
if len(text) > 4000:
    chunks = GeminiAnalyzer._chunk_text(text, 4000)
    text = chunks[0]

# Fallback keyword classification
classify_by_keywords()  # Robust fallback mechanism
```

### 4. Enhanced TTS Utils (`utils/tts_utils.py`)

#### Retry Logic and Error Handling
- **Retry Mechanism**: 3 attempts with increasing delays
- **File Verification**: Checks if audio files are created and have content
- **Rate Limiting**: 0.5-second delays between clause audio generation
- **Availability Testing**: `test_voice_availability()` method

#### Key Features
```python
# Retry logic
max_retries = 3
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        # TTS generation
        # File verification
        if output_path.exists() and output_path.stat().st_size > 0:
            return audio_path
    except Exception as e:
        await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Exponential backoff

# Rate limiting between clauses
await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
```

### 5. Enhanced Document Processor (`utils/document_processor.py`)

#### Rate Limiting and Logging
- **Processing Delays**: 1-second delays between major processing steps
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking
- **Error Isolation**: TTS failures don't stop document processing
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing even if some features fail

#### Key Features
```python
PROCESSING_DELAY = 1.0

# Rate limiting between steps
await asyncio.sleep(DocumentProcessor.PROCESSING_DELAY)

# Comprehensive logging
logger.info(f"Extracted {len(text)} characters of text")
logger.info(f"Document classified as: {doc_classification['doc_type']}")

# Error isolation
try:
    # TTS generation
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"TTS generation failed: {e}")
    # Continue without TTS
```

## Testing and Verification

### Test Script (`test_chunking_fixes.py`)
Created comprehensive test script to verify:
1. Document Type Classification with chunking
2. Named Entity Recognition
3. Clause Simplification with batching
4. TTS Generation with retry logic
5. Full Document Analysis with chunking

### Test Features
- Sample legal document (NDA) for testing
- All major functionality verification
- Error handling validation
- Performance monitoring

## Performance Improvements

### Before Fixes
- Large documents caused `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` errors
- TTS generation failed consistently
- No retry mechanisms
- No rate limiting

### After Fixes
- **Chunking**: Documents split into manageable pieces
- **Rate Limiting**: Controlled API call frequency
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when features fail
- **Logging**: Comprehensive progress tracking

## Configuration Options

### Rate Limiting
```python
# Gemini Utils
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 1.0  # Seconds between requests
MAX_RETRIES = 3         # Maximum retry attempts

# Clause Simplification
BATCH_SIZE = 3          # Clauses per batch
DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES = 2.0  # Seconds between batches

# Document Processor
PROCESSING_DELAY = 1.0  # Seconds between major steps

# TTS Utils
max_retries = 3         # TTS retry attempts
```

### Chunking
```python
# Text chunking
CHUNK_SIZE = 8000       # Characters per chunk
MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST = 30000  # Conservative token limit

# Document classification
CLASSIFICATION_CHUNK_SIZE = 4000  # For large documents
```

## Error Handling Strategy

### 1. API Rate Limits
- **Detection**: Check for "429" or "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED" in error messages
- **Response**: Exponential backoff with increasing delays
- **Fallback**: Continue with partial results if possible

### 2. TTS Failures
- **Detection**: File creation verification and size checks
- **Response**: Multiple retry attempts with delays
- **Fallback**: Continue without audio if TTS fails

### 3. Processing Failures
- **Isolation**: Individual feature failures don't stop entire process
- **Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: Return partial results with error indicators

## Usage Examples

### Basic Document Processing
```python
from utils.document_processor import DocumentProcessor

result = await DocumentProcessor.process_document(
    file_bytes=document_bytes,
    filename="contract.pdf",
    language="english",
    generate_tts=True,
    tts_voice="kore"
)
```

### Individual Feature Testing
```python
from utils.gemini_utils_optimized import GeminiAnalyzer
from utils.simplify_utils import ClauseSimplifier
from utils.doc_type_classifier import DocumentTypeClassifier

# Test chunked analysis
analysis = await GeminiAnalyzer.analyze_document(large_text, "english")

# Test clause simplification
simplified = await ClauseSimplifier.simplify_clauses(clauses, "english")

# Test document classification
classification = await DocumentTypeClassifier.classify_document(text, "english")
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Logging Levels
- **INFO**: Processing progress and successful operations
- **WARNING**: Retry attempts and non-critical failures
- **ERROR**: Critical failures and exceptions

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Chunk processing times
- API retry frequencies
- TTS success rates
- Overall processing completion rates

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic Chunking**: Adjust chunk size based on API response times
2. **Caching**: Cache processed chunks to avoid reprocessing
3. **Parallel Processing**: Process chunks in parallel where possible
4. **Advanced Retry**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for API calls
5. **Performance Metrics**: Add detailed performance monitoring

### Configuration Management
- Environment variable configuration
- Runtime configuration updates
- Performance-based auto-tuning

## Conclusion

The implemented chunking and fixes successfully resolve the quota limit issues and TTS generation problems. The system now:

1. **Handles Large Documents**: Splits documents into manageable chunks
2. **Respects Rate Limits**: Implements proper rate limiting and retry logic
3. **Provides Reliability**: Graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. **Maintains Performance**: Efficient processing with minimal delays
