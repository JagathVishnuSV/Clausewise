    NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
    
    This Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of January 1, 2024, by and between ABC Corporation, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 123 Main Street, New York, NY 10001 ("Disclosing Party"), and XYZ Company, a California corporation with its principal place of business at 456 Oak Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90210 ("Receiving Party").
    
    WHEREAS, the parties wish to explore a potential business relationship and may disclose to each other certain confidential and proprietary information;
    
    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:
    
    1. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. "Confidential Information" means any information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, which is designated as "Confidential," "Proprietary" or some similar designation, or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure.
    
    2. NON-USE AND NON-DISCLOSURE. The Receiving Party agrees not to use any Confidential Information for any purpose except to evaluate and engage in discussions concerning a potential business relationship between the parties. The Receiving Party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information to third parties or to the Receiving Party's employees, except to those employees who are required to have the information in order to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the potential business relationship and who have signed confidentiality agreements with the Receiving Party.
    
    3. MAINTENANCE OF CONFIDENTIALITY. The Receiving Party agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information. Without limiting the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature.
    
    4. TERM. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of three (3) years from the date of this Agreement.
    
    5. RETURN OF MATERIALS. Upon the termination of this Agreement or upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party all copies of Confidential Information in tangible form or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed.
    
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.
